# Rubber Duck Plugin Documentation

## Overview

The Rubber Duck plugin emulates a USB keyboard device to automatically type commands or execute keystrokes on the target system. It's an implementation of the popular USB Rubber Ducky concept using GreatFET hardware.

## Features

- Emulates a standard USB keyboard
- Can type text automatically on target systems
- Supports both plain text and DuckyScript formats
- Can execute special key combinations (Ctrl+Alt+T, Win+R, etc.)
- Configurable delays between keystrokes and commands
- Can read payloads from files or direct input

## Usage

### Basic Usage

To use the plugin with default settings:

1. Load the Rubber Duck plugin in the SAT Toolkit
2. Execute it with default parameters to type some basic commands

The default payload will:
- Type "echo Hello from Rubber Duck!"
- Type "id"
- Type "ls -la"

### Custom Payloads

You can specify custom payloads in two ways:

1. **Direct payload parameter**: Provide the commands to type directly in the `payload` parameter.
2. **Script file**: Specify a path to a text file containing commands using the `script_file` parameter.

### Payload Formats

The plugin supports two payload formats:

#### 1. Plain Text Format (Default)

Each line in the payload will be typed followed by an Enter key:

```
echo Hello World
whoami
ls -la
```

#### 2. DuckyScript Format

Set `payload_format` to "ducky" to use the DuckyScript format, which provides more control over keystrokes:

```
REM This is a comment
DELAY 1000
STRING echo Hello World
ENTER
CTRL ALT DELETE
GUI r
```

### DuckyScript Commands

- `REM` - Comment line, ignored during execution
- `DELAY <ms>` - Pause for specified milliseconds
- `STRING <text>` - Type the specified text
- `ENTER`, `SPACE`, `TAB`, etc. - Press the specified key
- `CTRL`, `ALT`, `SHIFT`, `GUI` (Windows key) - Modifier keys
- Combinations of modifier keys and regular keys (e.g., `CTRL ALT DELETE`)

### Example DuckyScript Files

This directory contains some example DuckyScript files:

- **linux_infogather.txt**: Opens a terminal on Linux and gathers system information
- **windows_payload.txt**: Opens PowerShell on Windows and executes information gathering commands

### Parameters

| Parameter | Description | Default |
|-----------|-------------|---------|
| `payload` | Commands to type (each line executed as a separate command) | Basic demo commands |
| `delay_before_typing` | Time to wait in seconds before starting to type | 2 |
| `delay_between_lines` | Time to wait in seconds between typing each line | 0.5 |
| `script_file` | Path to a script file containing commands to type | "" (empty) |
| `payload_format` | Format of the payload: "plain" or "ducky" | "plain" |

## Security Considerations

- The Rubber Duck is a powerful tool that can execute arbitrary commands on the target system
- Always use this tool responsibly and only on systems you have permission to access
- Be aware that some antivirus software may detect rapid keyboard input as suspicious

## Troubleshooting

- If commands are typing too fast for the target system, increase the `delay_between_lines` parameter
- Some systems may have security measures that block USB devices or require user approval
- Special key combinations may work differently across operating systems
